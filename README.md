# Bookshelf Application

## Phase 1

Reading plays a big part of personal development, lifelong learning, and becoming a better thinker. 
And if you're anything like me, you have read a lot of books, but have probably forgotten most of the stuff you’ve read 
and haven’t applied it to your life the way that you would have liked. There is a phenomenon in memory research called 
the forgetting curve, which just shows that over time, our memory for everything decays unless we find a way to engage 
with it or consolidate our memory of the thing. A few months ago, I realized that I don't absorb anything I read and 
even forget which books I’ve read, so I've been actively working to engage with the material I'm reading.

The bookshelf application allows people to engage with the reading material beyond just passively reading it. 
It consists of a list of books you’ve read and allows you to categorize them based on whether it’s fiction or 
non-fiction, the author of the book, and book’s genre. It also allows you rate the book, add the dates when you 
finished the book. You can also select a book and depending on whether it is non-fiction or fiction, there will be 
categories that can be filled out, such as summary, how I discovered it, impressions and thoughts, quotes, and notes.
